Sprint 3 Review

I have finished the GUI despite it being atrocious to look at. The tests only test the api call and database functions. 
I was unsure how to test the GUI. The actions work as well. 

Functionality

This project uses an API call to grab the responses to a wufoo form and submit them into a database. We Then get a GUI
that lists the submissions and is clickable for  nicer view within a second window.
